# discord-verification

A framework to integrate a verification system with your Discord guild built with DiscordJS

This library integrates an email sender by default using [Twilio SendGrid](https://www.twilio.com/sendgrid/email-api). You can obviously integrate your own system that communicates a code to the user (eg: an SMS sender, an authentication application or whatever suits your case the best).
