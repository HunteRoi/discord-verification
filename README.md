# discord-verification
A framework to integrate a verification system with your Discord guild built with DiscordJS

This library integrates an email sender by default using Twilio SendGrid. You can obviously integrate your own system that communicates a code to the user (eg: an SMS sender, an authentication application or whatever best suits your case, etc.).
